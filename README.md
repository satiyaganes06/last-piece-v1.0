<h1 align="center">lastPiece : M-Commerce App</h1>

<p align="center">University Malaysia Pahang (UMP) students are big in number, and not most of the students do not know how to buy a used book from their seniors. In addition, most seniors also do not know how to sell their used books to their juniors. However, it is assumed that almost 40% of UMP students use some other platform to sell their used books, such as UMP E-Community, WhatsApp, Instagram, and many more.  But still, there is no fixed platforms to use to sell and buy the used book. In this case, the buyer faces many problems compared to the seller because the seller of the book can use any platform to sell their used books, but the buyer does not know the correct platforms that the seller used. Furthermore, some faculty official sells their faculty books in another e-commerce website such as ad Shopee, Lazada, and other social media platform. Besides that, Why the used books are essential to junior students? Part of the answer is that not every student is born with a silver spoon because all students have their own financial problem, and most students cannot afford to buy a new university-level book.
Hence, in between the seller of the used books, the senior, and the used book buyer, the junior must have a complete application that works as a middleman. So, UMP students need an application to let them know what and how many second-hand books are available, and if the book the student is searching for is available in the app, they can buy the book using this app. </p>

<p align="center">By using this application, the user can sell or buy the used book, but the user of the application also can access more than 100 expensive and exclusive eBooks and audiobook for free, and this feature is only available to the user who uses this application.  In the future, we add more eBooks and Audiobooks to encourage the user of this application. Moreover, this is the application's unique feature, other systems like Scribe, Amazon Kindle, and Shopee do not offer this feature to their user. This is one technique like BOGOF (Buy One, Get One) to attract users to use this application to buy or sell their used books. </p>
